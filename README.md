# social-media-app
in this app I used MERN stack to build a social media app from scratch.
For backend operations i used jwt for auth operations, mongoose, express, validator, bcrypt, express-jwt;
For frontend operations i created my react app using create-react-app, axios for dealing with http requests, also i used react-icons.
